    <h2>History of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>

    <div class="event">

    <p>The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fascinating story of how humans dreamed of giving machines the ability to “think and learn” — and turned that dream into reality. 
    In the 1950s, <strong>Alan Turing</strong> asked the question, <em>“Can machines think?”</em> — marking the beginning of AI’s journey. 
    In 1956, at the <strong>Dartmouth Conference</strong>, the term <em>“Artificial Intelligence”</em> was officially coined. 
    Since then, AI has evolved from symbolic reasoning to machine learning, deep learning, and now, the age of Generative AI.
    </p>

    <p>
    The early years of AI were marked by high optimism and groundbreaking experiments in logical reasoning and problem-solving. 
    However, limited computing power and data availability led to the first “AI winter,” a period of slowed progress and reduced funding. 
    Despite these challenges, research in the 1980s and 1990s revived the field through expert systems, robotics, and neural networks — laying the groundwork for modern AI technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the 21st century, AI has rapidly evolved due to the explosion of big data and advanced computing. 
    Deep learning algorithms, massive datasets, and innovations like GPT, DALL·E, and AlphaGo have transformed AI into a creative and decision-making force. 
    Today, AI not only understands and analyzes information but also generates text, art, music, and video — becoming the digital reflection of human intelligence and creativity.

  <h2>AI Development Timeline</h2>

  <div class="timeline">

    <div class="event">
      <h3>1940s – Early Concepts</h3>
      <p>
        During the 1940s, scientists began exploring whether machines could mimic human reasoning.
        In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created the first model of an artificial neuron,
        laying the theoretical foundation for Artificial Intelligence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>1950 – The Turing Test</h3>
      <p>
        British mathematician <strong>Alan Turing</strong> published “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” and asked,
        “Can machines think?”. He introduced the <em>Turing Test</em> — if a machine could mimic human conversation,
        it could be considered intelligent.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>1956 – Birth of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <p>
        The term <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> was first introduced at the <strong>Dartmouth Conference</strong>.
        Pioneers like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Herbert Simon established AI as a formal academic field,
        aiming to build machines that could learn and reason like humans.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>1960s–1970s – Early AI Programs</h3>
      <p>
        Researchers created symbolic reasoning and logic-based programs.
        Famous examples include <strong>ELIZA</strong> (1966), a chatbot that simulated human conversation,
        and the <strong>General Problem Solver</strong>, which tackled mathematical reasoning.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>1980s – The Era of Expert Systems</h3>
      <p>
        With improved computing power, AI entered the “Expert Systems” era.
        These programs replicated human expert decision-making using “if–then” rules.
        One famous system, <strong>MYCIN</strong>, helped diagnose bacterial infections.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>1997 – Deep Blue Defeats Kasparov</h3>
      <p>
        IBM’s <strong>Deep Blue</strong>, a chess-playing AI, defeated world champion Garry Kasparov.
        This historic win demonstrated the computational and strategic power of AI systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>2000s – Machine Learning Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        With the rise of the internet, vast amounts of data became available.
        AI systems learned to recognize patterns and make predictions through <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>,
        marking a major step toward modern AI.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>2012 – The Deep Learning Revolution</h3>
      <p>
        The breakthrough of <strong>Deep Neural Networks</strong> transformed AI research.
        The <strong>AlexNet</strong> model won the ImageNet competition, showcasing exceptional image recognition capabilities
        and launching the modern deep learning era.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>2016 – AlphaGo Beats Lee Sedol</h3>
      <p>
        Google DeepMind’s <strong>AlphaGo</strong> defeated world Go champion Lee Sedol.
        The victory proved that AI could master intuition and complex strategies beyond human capabilities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="event">
      <h3>2020s – The Rise of Generative AI</h3>
      <p>
        AI has now entered the creative age. Models like <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>DALL·E</strong>, and <strong>Midjourney</strong>
        can generate text, art, music, and videos. This era, known as <em>Generative AI</em>,
        shows machines collaborating with human imagination to create entirely new ideas.
